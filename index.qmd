# About

## Personal Bio
My name is Diana Liu and I am a 3rd year student at the University of Toronto Specializing in accounting and minoring in statistics. As an aspiring CPA, I am dedicated to client service through teamwork and problem solving. My interpersonal skills were developed through extensive experience in student leadership where I led teams to achieve fundraising and budgeting solutions as well as positive on-going relationships between students organizations, university staff, and outside donors. Along with my strong academic background in accounting, I am proficient in MS Office Suite, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, Python, and R. I am always looking to improve my skills and apply them in novel ways which is why my career goal is not only to become an experienced CPA but also an expert in accounting technologies, especially emerging tools like AI.
